/*To modify the given C program so that the name array and score are user-defined and dynamically allocated, we can use pointers and dynamic memory allocation with malloc. We'll also format the output to display the names and scores in a table format. Here's how you can achieve that:

Explanation:
Dynamic Memory Allocation: We use malloc to allocate memory for an array of player structures and for each player's name. This allows the user to define the number of players and their names dynamically.


Input Handling: We loop through the number of players to get their names and scores.


Table Formatting: We print the names and scores in a formatted table using printf with specific formatting options (%-12s for left-aligned names in a field of width 12).


Memory Management: After we're done using the dynamically allocated memory, we free it to avoid memory leaks.


Usage:
Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc) and run it. It will prompt you to enter the number of players, followed by their names and scores, and finally display the results in a table format.*/
