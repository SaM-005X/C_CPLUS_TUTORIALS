The '#include' directive in C is a preprocessor instruction that tells the compiler to insert the contents of a specified file into the current program.

itâ€™s a header file that provides prototypes (function declarations) for standard input/output functions, such as 'printf()' and 'scanf()'. */

int main()/* The 'int main()' function is the entry point of a C program. 
It is the function that the operating system calls when the program is executed.
The 'main()' function is required in every C program, as it is the starting point from which the program's execution begins.
The int return type indicates that the main() function is expected to return an integer value, 
which is typically used to indicate the status of the program's execution.
A return value of 0 usually indicates a successful execution, while a non-zero value indicates an error. */
